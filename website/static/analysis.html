<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>ANALYSIS</b></font></p>

<p>Let's review the definitions of drivers and guides, as
documented in <a
href="ftp://ftp.frontiernet.net/pub/users/aliquot/3630finishes.pdf">3630finishes.pdf</a>:<br>
A <b>guide</b> consists of $2^a$ ($a \gt 0$)
along with a subset of the prime factors of $\sigma(2^a)$.<br/>
A<b> driver</b> is a special type of guide that takes
the form $2^a v$
where $v \mid \sigma(2^a)$ and $2^{a-1} \mid \sigma(v)$. The second
statement enables <b>2 </b>to qualify as a driver, and
is descriptively termed the <b>downdriver</b>. In
addition, <b>2</b><sup><sup><b>3</b></sup></sup><b>
· 3</b> also qualifies as a driver under this definition.</p>

<p>I propose to extend the lexicon of aliquot sequences as
follows:<br>
For the odd integer $t \gt 1$, write $\sigma(t) = 2^b \cdot u$ where $u$ is odd. Then $b$
is defined as the <b>2s count</b> of $t$. ([tooz], not [too-es]) <br />
Let $v$ be the product of a subset of the prime factors of
$\sigma(2^a)$ and $b$ the
2s count of $v$. Define the <b>class</b> of the
guide $2^a v$ to
be $a - b$. Here are how various drivers and guides fit into
the resulting classes:</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><u>Class -1</u></b></font><font
size="3"><b><u><br>
</u></b></font>Even perfect numbers:<br>
2 · 3<br>
2^2 · 7<br>
2^4 · 31<br>
2^6 · 127</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><u>Class 0<br>
</u></b></font>2^3 · 3 · 5<br>
2^5 · 3 · 7<br>
<font size="3">2^9 </font>·<font size="3"> 3 </font>·<font
size="3"> 11 </font>·<font size="3"> 31</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b><u>Class 1<br>
</u></b></font>2<br>
2^3 · 3</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><u>Class 2<br>
</u></b></font>2^2<br>
2^3 · 5<br>
2^5 · 7</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><u>Class 3<br>
</u></b></font>2^3<br>
2^5 · 3</p>

<p>Let $n_i = 2^a v \cdot s \cdot t$ be a member of an aliquot sequence where
$2^a v$ is its guide,
$s$ is the product of the odd prime factors of $n_i$
whose exponents are even and $t \gt 1$ the product
of the remaining factors. Let a change in the exponent $a$
be termed a <b>mutation</b>. This occurs only when the
2s count of $t$ is equal to or less than the class of $2^a v$. In the
former case, the exponent $a$ increases and in the latter,
$a$ is reduced to the 2s count of $t$. The
stability of a guide depends upon its class: the smaller the
class, the more stable the guide. For example, a class 2 guide
will <b>mutate</b> if $t$ is the product of two
primes of the form $4n+1$ or is a prime of the form $8n+3$ or $4n+1$.
But a class 1 guide mutates only when $t$ is a prime of
the form $4n+1$. When the class of a driver is zero or -1, a small
2s count of $t$ is not sufficient in itself to effect a
change in the exponent $a$ because the 2s count of $t$
is always greater than zero. Help is required from one of the
components of $v$ by having its exponent aquire an even
power in order to temporarily raise the driver's class above
zero. For example, when the 2^2 · 7 driver takes the form 2^2 ·
7^2, its class of -1 temporarily increases by 3 (the 2s count of
7) so a mutation will occur when the 2s count of $t$ is 2
or 1.</p>

<p>A sequence decreases in a significant and reliable way only
when it is driven by the downdriver. This explains why the
overall trend is up: the downdriver is badly outnumbered by those drivers
that propel sequences upwards. And to make matters worse, the
principle ones are of class zero or -1 and thus more stable than
the downdriver, which is of class one. When a long run of the
downdriver ends in mutation, the likelyhood is that
the next driver that is aquired will be one of the others,
sending the sequence upwards. In fact, it is not uncommon for the
downdriver to mutate directly to 2^2 · 7. Any of the drivers
listed at the top of the main page has the potential to send a
sequence beyond the range of practical computation, especially
those of class -1. When a sequence is adrift, not propelled by a
driver or guide, it is at constant risk of aquiring one that
sends it upwards: every time the exponent of 2 changes, there is
a chance that the new $2^a$ is
accompanied by one or more of the factors of $\sigma(2^a)$,
thus producing a driver, or a guide such as 2^3 · 5 or 2^5 · 7.
It is inevitable that this will happen as a sequence goes through
a long series of mutations. </p>
