These are the files I use to run the website at <http://dubslow.tk/aliquot/>.
The html/ folder is where you should point your server, and the py/ folder
contains the scripts used. They are meant to be run primarily from cron;
this is my current crontab:

7 * * * * /home/bill/bin/allseq.py >> /home/bill/bin/allseq.log 2>&1
47 18,6 * * * /home/bill/bin/alimerge.py >> /home/bill/bin/alimerge.log 2>&1

Adjust the directories as necessary.

allseq.py can also be run manually; in that case, it takes the sequences to be
updated as arguments.

Most of the scripts have some sort of directory hard coded into them -- be sure
to examine the top of each of them and set the directories accordingly. allseq.py
has some other settings that are hardcoded, such as which sequences are broken
in the FDB, and you can also tell it to drop sequences.

If you want email alerts from the allseq.py and alimerge.py, you'll need to put
your information in myutils.py -- setup should be the same as e.g. Thunderbird.
It is currently configured for Gmail as a reference.

Let me know via Github or MersenneForum PM if something doesn't work right -- 
I'm not sure if everything has been properly sanitized from my files. For
instance, the Python files might need their working directory adjusted to
find each other.
