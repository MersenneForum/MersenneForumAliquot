<p align="center"><h2 id="top">A small aside concerning $\tau$ of prime powers</h2></p>

<p>
In case you've come here without having read the <a href="intro-analysis.html">main page</a>, here's a short
summary of the definitions used: let $\sigma$ be the traditional sum of divisors function. Let $n$ be a positive
integer, and factor it as $2^x \cdot m$, $m$ odd. Then define the function $f$ as $f(n) = 2^x$, and note that it
is completely multiplicative ($f(xy) = f(x) f(y)$ $\forall x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$); define the function $\beta$ as
$\beta = \log_2(f(n))$, and note that it is "logarithmically completely multiplicative" in the sense that
$\beta(xy) = \beta(x) + \beta(y)$; and finally define the function $\tau$ as $\tau(n) = \beta(\sigma(n))$. Since
$\sigma$ is multiplicative and $f$ completely so, we have that $\tau(mn) = \tau(m) + \tau(n)$ whenever $m$ and
$n$ are relatively prime.
</p>

<p>
Next note that according to the definition of $\beta$, we have the criterion that $\beta(n) = x \iff n \equiv 2^x
\pmod{2^{x+1}}$, and correspondingly if $p$ is a prime, then $\tau(p) = x \iff p \equiv 2^x - 1 \pmod{2^{x+1}}$.
Next we consider powers of $p$: $\tau(p^a) = \beta(\sigma(p^a))$. If $a$ is even, then $\sigma(p^a)$ is odd, and
so $\tau(p^a)$ is 0 (to the benefit of aliquot sequence workers trying to break the worst drivers).
</p>
<p>
Otherwise $a$ is odd, and we then define $a=2k+1$ and write $\sigma(p^a) = \sum_{j=0}^a{p^j} =
\sum_{i=0}^{k}({p^{2i}+p^{2i+1})}$. Next we can factor out the $(p+1)$, whence $\sigma(p^a) = (p+1)\cdot
\sum_{i=0}^k{p^{2i}}$. But note that since we have $p \equiv 2^x - 1 \pmod {2^{x+1}}$, we can compute that
$p^2 \equiv 2^{2x} - 2^{x+1} + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod {2^{x+1}}$, and inductively we have $p^3 \equiv p$ and thus
$p^{2i} \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{x+1}}$. We thus have a sum of $l = k+1$ terms which are $1 \pmod{2^{x+1}}$, such that
$\sum_{i=0}^k{p^{2i}} \equiv l \pmod{2^{x+1}}$, and so at least when $2^{x+1} \nmid l$, we have that $\tau(p^a) =
\beta((p+1)\cdot \sum_{i=0}^k{p^{2i}}) = \tau(p) + \beta(l)$. The issue when $\beta(l) \geq x+1$ is of course that
while we know the $2^{x+1}$ divides the sum, we can't say for sure with this argument if $2^{x+2}$ divides the sum
or not, when for the proposition to hold, we must have that the sum is conrguent to $2^{\beta(l)}
\pmod{2^{\beta(l)+1}}$. And so if $2^{x+1} \mid l$ we can only say then that $\tau(p^a) \geq \tau(p) +
x+1$.
</p>

<p>
But in fact, in my numerical tests, I have been unable to find a counter example where $\tau(p^a) \neq \tau(p) +
\beta(l)$, where the search extended to $p \lt 10^9$, and each prime was tested up to $a = 99$. I believe this
should certainly cover any pathological case where the odd parts of the $p^{2i}$ terms add up to more than the
specified power of two (which is certainly easy to do with two arbitrary odd numbers); alas, I have been unable
to prove the proposition. Any thoughts on the matter would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>
(As an aside on the nature of such things, if you add a bunch of random numbers that are $1 \pmod{4}$, then for
most iterations you get that $\beta$ of the sum is $\beta$ of the number of terms, but there are plenty where they
differ for the same reason as above. On the other hand, if you sum an arithmetic sequence, [such as all numbers
that are $1 \pmod{4}$ starting with 1 and increasing uniformly], then the equality indeed holds: let $a_i = a_0 +
d \cdot i$ be an arithmetic sequence of difference $d$, and let $S_n$ be its $n$th partial sum (of $l = n+1$
terms). Then $\beta(S_n) = \beta(\sum_{i=0}^{n}{(a_0 + d \cdot i)}) = \beta(l\cdot a_0 + d \cdot
\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i}) = \beta(l\cdot a_0 + d \cdot \frac{n\cdot l}{2})$. Now if we assume that $a_0$ is odd and that
$2^2 \mid d$, then we may factor out the $l$ and $\beta(S_n) = \beta(l) + \beta(a_0 + \frac{d}{2} \cdot n)$, where
$d/2$ is even, so the latter term is 0 and we have that $\beta(S_n) = \beta(n+1)$, which is analogous to what we
want above for $\sigma(p^a)$ [which is of course a geometric series rather than an arithmetic series].)
