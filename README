This is a suite of various semi-related software concerning MersenneForum's
Aliquot sequences forum. Of most note is the website that maintains the current
status of all sequences less than 10^6 -- its primary script, as well as all
HTML templates, are included in this repository. The primary script relies on
the various other things located here as well.

The website/ folder contains the relevant HTML/JS/CSS/etc.

The scripts/ folder contains the main website script, as well as the
reservations tracking script, a small script to find sequences with drivers
susceptible to breaking, and the merge detecting script.

The mfaliquot/ package contains the numtheory.py and aliquot.py modules
I wrote while I was talking a number theory course -- the former module has a
lot of unrelated-to-aliquot material, but has a bunch of relevant stuff as well,
which aliquot.py and in turn the website and other scripts depend on.

The fdb/ pseudo-package can be ignored for now. (I had the ambitious idea of
writing a Python package that extends some HTML parsing done in the scripts/
folder into a complete FDB "API" that interacts with the HTML. Work halted for
the forseeable future.)
